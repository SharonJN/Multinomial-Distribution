# MULTIVARIATE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
The multivariate normal distribution is a fundamental concept in statistics, extending the idea of the univariate normal distribution to multiple variables. It characterizes the joint behavior of two or more random variables, where each variable follows a normal distribution and is linearly related to the others. In a multivariate normal distribution, the variables are typically correlated, meaning that changes in one variable are associated with proportional changes in others. This distribution is fully described by a mean vector and a covariance matrix, where the mean vector represents the average value of each variable, and the covariance matrix accounts for the spread and interrelationship between variables. Properties like elliptical contours in the density function, defined by the covariance matrix, signify that observations are more likely to cluster around the mean values and exhibit a predictable pattern of dispersion along with linear combinations of variables.

Multivariate normality finds extensive use across various fields, including finance, economics, and natural sciences, due to its mathematical tractability and practical applications in modeling complex systems. It serves as a foundational assumption in many statistical methods, such as multivariate regression, factor analysis, and discriminant analysis. Assessing multivariate normality is crucial for valid statistical inferences, as violations of this assumption might affect the accuracy and reliability of statistical analyses. Techniques such as visual diagnostics (e.g., QQ plots), multivariate normality tests (e.g., Henze-Zirkler or Mardia tests), and exploratory data analysis aid in evaluating and ensuring the appropriateness of the multivariate normal distribution assumption for robust statistical inference.


## QUESTION 1

### (a) Generating 1000 random samples from a bivariate normal distribution
The `mvtnorm` library to generate 1000 samples from a bivariate normal distribution with a mean vector of [2, 3] and a covariance matrix of [[1, 0.5], [0.5, 2]]. The `rmvnorm` function is employed to create these samples, which are stored in the variable `multnorm.sample`. 

```{r}
# Define parameters
library(mvtnorm)  # Load the library for the mvrnorm function

# Mean vector
mu <- c(2, 3)  
# Covariance matrix
sig <- matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.5, 2), nrow = 2)  

# Generate 1000 random samples
#set.seed(123)  # Set seed for reproducibility
samples <- rmvnorm(n = 1000, mean = mu, sigma = sig)
head(samples)

```

### (b) Plotting the generated samples using a scatter plot
The `plot()` function is used to create a scatter plot of these generated samples, where each point on the plot represents a pair of values from the bivariate distribution. The `xlab`, `ylab`, and `main` parameters are utilized to label the `X-axis`, `Y-axis`, and provide a title for the plot, respectively.
```{r}
# Scatter plot
plot(samples, col = "blue", main = "Scatter Plot of Bivariate Normal Distribution Samples", pch = 16, xlab = "X-axis", ylab = "Y-axis")

```

The scatter plot illustrates the distribution of 1000 samples generated from a bivariate normal distribution characterized by a mean vector [μ₁ = 2, μ₂ = 3] and a covariance matrix [[σ₁² = 1, ρ = 0.5], [ρ = 0.5, σ₂² = 2]]. Each plotted point corresponds to a pair of values (X, Y) showcasing the relationship between the two variables. The blue-colored points, arranged in a clustered manner, depict the distribution's central tendency around the mean vector. The plot's overall pattern reflects the positive correlation between X and Y, where an increase in one variable tends to correspond with an increase in the other, displaying a tendency for the points to slope in a particular direction. This visualization provides an immediate understanding of the distribution's structure, correlation, and spread, giving insight into how the generated data conforms to the specified bivariate normal distribution parameters.



## QUESTION 2
### (a) Creating a grid for a bivariate normal distribution 

```{r}
library(mvtnorm)

# Creating a grid for the bivariate normal distribution
x <- seq(-1, 7, length.out = 50)
y <- seq(-1, 7, length.out = 50)
grid <- expand.grid(x = x, y = y)
head(grid)
```

Grid Creation: The code initializes a grid for the bivariate normal distribution using the expand.grid() function. It defines sequences of values for X and Y variables using the seq() function. In this case, the sequences are generated from -1 to 7 with a length of 50, resulting in 50 equally spaced values for each variable. The expand.grid() function then creates a grid of combinations of these X and Y values, resulting in a total of 2500 pairs of values (50 values for X paired with 50 values for Y).

Grid Representation: The grid variable stores the resulting grid as a data frame, showcasing the combinations of X and Y values. Each row in the data frame represents a unique pair of X and Y values within the specified ranges. For instance, the first row might contain (-1, -1), the second row (-1, -0.755), and so on, covering all possible combinations within the defined intervals.

Overall, this code constructs a structured grid of values for X and Y, serving as a basis for calculating the bivariate normal distribution's densities or probabilities at specific points within this defined space.


### (b) Calculating the bivariate normal density for each point in the grid
This code calculates the density values for the previously created grid of values representing the bivariate normal distribution and converts the resulting vector of densities into a matrix format for easier interpretation and visualization.

```{r}
# Calculate density over the specified grid
dens <- dmvnorm(x= as.matrix(grid), mean=mu, sigma=sig)

# Covert to the matrix
dens1 <- matrix(dens, nrow = 50)
head(dens1)
```

Calculating Density: The `dmvnorm()` function from the `mvtnorm` package is employed to compute the density values for each pair of X and Y values in the grid. The x argument takes the grid values converted into a matrix format using `as.matrix(grid)`. It computes the density values based on the specified mean vector `mu` and covariance matrix `sig` for the bivariate normal distribution.

Reshaping Density Values: The calculated density values, stored in the dens variable, are initially in a vector format. To facilitate visualization or analysis, the code transforms these values into a matrix format using the matrix() function. The resulting matrix dens1 organizes the density values into a 50x50 grid, corresponding to the 50 values of X and Y each, representing the entire grid that was initially created.

Matrix Representation: The dens1 matrix displays the density values corresponding to each cell in the grid. Each cell contains the calculated density value, representing the likelihood of observing data at the specific combination of X and Y values within the bivariate normal distribution.

Overall, this code computes and organizes the density values over the grid, providing a visual representation of how the density of the bivariate normal distribution varies across different combinations of X and Y values within the specified intervals.


### (c) Plotting the bivariate normal density
#### Plotting the bivariate normal density using a perspective plot:
The plot illustrates a three-dimensional surface where the X and Y axes correspond to the variables of the bivariate normal distribution, and the `Z-axis` represents the density values. The surface's peaks and valleys denote regions of higher and lower density, respectively, across the X and Y variable space.
The surface is colored cyan, emphasizing the density variations. Darker regions indicate higher density, while lighter areas signify lower density within the distribution.
The plot visually portrays how the density values change across different combinations of `X` and `Y` values within the specified intervals. Peaks on the surface correspond to areas where observations are more likely to occur, while valleys represent regions of lower likelihood.
 The angle of the plot, controlled by theta and phi parameters, offers a specific perspective on the density surface, allowing for a comprehensive view of the distribution's structure from different angles.
 
```{r}
# Create a perspective plot
persp(dens1, theta = 80, phi = 30, expand = 0.6, shade = 0.2, col = "cyan", xlab = "x", ylab = "y", zlab = "dens")

```

The 3D perspective plot represents the density surface of the bivariate normal distribution, using the `X` and `Y` axes to display the variables and the `Z-axis` to depict density values. The cyan-colored surface showcases peaks and valleys, indicating areas of higher and lower density across the X and Y variable space. Darker regions signify higher density, while lighter areas denote lower density within the distribution. This visualization offers a comprehensive portrayal of how density fluctuates across various combinations of `X` and `Y` values within the specified intervals, allowing for the identification of regions where observations are more or less likely to occur. The labeled axes ensure clarity regarding the represented variables, providing a graphical understanding of the distribution's density distribution and aiding in recognizing patterns within the distribution.

#### Plotting the bivariate normal density using a contour plot:
This code first creates a grid of points using `expand.grid()` for the X and Y axes, defining ranges and intervals for the bivariate normal distribution. Then, it calculates the bivariate normal density for each point in the grid using `dmvnorm()` with the specified mean and covariance values. Finally, the `contour()` function is used to create a contour plot of these densities, where the contours represent different levels of density.

Adjust the `x`, `y`, and `length.out` values in the `seq()` function to modify the range and density of the grid points, and alter the plot labels and title as needed for your specific visualization requirements.

```{r}
library(mvtnorm)

# Creating a grid for the bivariate normal distribution
x <- seq(-1, 6, length.out = 50)
y <- seq(-1, 7, length.out = 50)
grid <- expand.grid(x = x, y = y)

# Calculating the bivariate normal density for each point in the grid
densities <- matrix(dmvnorm(grid, mean = mu, sigma = sig), nrow = length(x))

# Plotting the bivariate normal density using a contour plot
contour(x, y, densities, xlab = "X-axis", ylab = "Y-axis", col = "red", main = "Contour Plot of Bivariate Normal Density")

```

The contour plot visualizes the bivariate normal density using lines, or contours, to represent regions of constant density across the `X` and `Y` variable space. Each contour line corresponds to a specific density level, with closer contours indicating higher density regions and wider separations marking lower density areas. In this plot, the red-colored contours illustrate the varying density levels of the bivariate normal distribution. The labeled X and Y axes provide clarity on the represented variables, allowing for an interpretation of how the distribution's density changes across different combinations of `X` and `Y` values. This visualization aids in identifying areas of higher or lower likelihood for observations within the distribution, presenting a clear depiction of the distribution's density surface and its variations.



## QUESTION 3
### (a) Calculating Probabilities
The `pmvnorm` function enables the calculation of probabilities associated with specific regions within a multivariate normal distribution, assessing the likelihood that observations from a multivariate dataset fall within defined boundaries. By utilizing the mean vector and covariance matrix to characterize central tendencies and relationships among multiple variables, this function computes the cumulative probability of a multivariate random variable meeting specified conditions or residing within a particular region. This numerical representation of probability aids in understanding the concentration of observations within defined boundaries in multidimensional spaces, providing valuable insights for decision-making, risk assessment, and hypothesis testing across diverse fields such as finance, engineering, and social sciences. However, the accuracy of calculated probabilities is contingent upon accurately defining the region of interest and relies on the assumption that the dataset adheres to a multivariate normal distribution.


#### Calculating probability within a specified region:
This code calculates the probability within a specific region of interest defined by `X > 1` and `Y < 4` in a bivariate normal distribution. It employs the `pnorm()` function, which calculates probabilities under the normal distribution curve. The calculation involves two parts: determining the probability that `Y` is less than 4, assuming a mean of 3 and a standard deviation of the square root of 2, and the probability that `X` is greater than 1, assuming a mean of 2 and a standard deviation of 1. Multiplying these probabilities together estimates the joint probability of both conditions being satisfied, representing the likelihood of observing values within the specified region of interest. 

```{r}
# Choose region of interest
region_probability <- pnorm(4, mean = 3, sd = sqrt(2)) * (1 - pnorm(1, mean = 2, sd = 1))

# Print resulting probability
print(region_probability)

```

The calculated probability offers insights into the relative occurrence or likelihood of observing values within the specified region of interest in the bivariate normal distribution. Specifically, it quantifies the probability that both conditions $(X > 1)$ and $(Y < 4)$ are met simultaneously. A higher probability, such as the calculated value of approximately 0.640, indicates a higher likelihood of observing data points within this particular region. This insight suggests that, within the distribution, there's a relatively substantial proportion of observations conforming to these criteria. It aids in understanding the relative prevalence of this specific data pattern and provides valuable information for decision-making, statistical inference, or identifying significant areas within the distribution that may have implications in analyses or interpretations.


The code utilizes the `mvtnorm` package in R to calculate the probability within a defined region of interest in a bivariate normal distribution. It sets the region of interest by specifying lower and upper limits for X and Y variables: $X > 1$ and $Y < 4$, respectively. The `pmvnorm()` function computes the probability that observations fall within this specified region using the provided mean vector $mu$ and covariance matrix $sig$ that define the bivariate normal distribution's parameters. Finally, the code prints the calculated probability, providing a quantitative measure of the likelihood that data points within the distribution meet the criteria of falling within the specified X and Y boundaries. This probability estimation offers valuable insight into the occurrence of this particular region within the bivariate normal distribution.

```{r}
# Load the mvtnorm package
library(mvtnorm)

# Define the region of interest
lower_limits <- c(1, -Inf)  # X > 1
upper_limits <- c(Inf, 3)  # Y < 4

# Calculate the probability within the specified region
probability <- pmvnorm(lower = lower_limits, upper = upper_limits, mean = mu, sigma = sig)

# Print the calculated probability
print(paste("Probability within the region of interest:", probability))

```

The resulting probability value of 0.387 quantifies the proportion of observations within the distribution that satisfy both conditions simultaneously, offering a numerical measure of the likelihood of encountering data points within this particular region. It serves as a quantitative assessment of the occurrence of this specific data pattern within the bivariate normal distribution, aiding in statistical inference, decision-making, or understanding the relative prevalence of this region within the distribution's overall structure.

### (b) Significance of the calculated probability

#### Significance of the calculated probability of: 0.6396323
The calculated probability of approximately 0.64 holds significant meaning within the context of the bivariate normal distribution. It represents the likelihood that observations fall within the defined region where X > 1 and Y < 4. This probability indicates that about 64% of the data points from this distribution are expected to satisfy these specific criteria. A higher probability suggests a relatively higher concentration of observations within this particular region, signifying that these combinations of X and Y values are more likely to occur compared to other areas. Understanding such probabilities aids in identifying and quantifying the occurrence of specific patterns within the distribution, facilitating informed decision-making and statistical analysis based on these likelihoods within defined regions.

#### Significance of the calculated probability of: 0.386573221428549
The calculated probability of approximately 0.387 signifies that, among all possible observations within this distribution, about 38.7% fall within the specified boundaries of having X > 1 and Y < 4. This numerical value provides a quantitative understanding of how likely or probable it is to encounter data points that satisfy these conditions.

In practical terms, it means that if you were to randomly pick points from this bivariate normal distribution, roughly 38.7% of those points would have X > 1 and Y < 4. This information aids in grasping the relative prevalence or scarcity of such data patterns within the distribution, offering insights into the distribution's structure and helping in making informed decisions or conducting statistical analyses based on the observed probabilities within specific regions.



## QUESTION 4
### (a) & (b) Taking a sample and testing for multivariate normality:
#### Multivariate Normality Test using MardiaTest
Mardia's test stands as a statistical technique utilized to evaluate multivariate normality by scrutinizing the skewness and kurtosis of a dataset. This method extends the concepts of skewness and kurtosis from univariate to multivariate distributions, employing a test statistic derived from standardized variables' skewness and kurtosis measures.

A low p-value (<0.05) resulting from Mardia's test indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis that the dataset adheres to a multivariate normal distribution. This suggests significant deviations from multivariate normality, potentially implying the presence of asymmetry, heavy-tailed distributions, or other departures from the characteristics expected in a multivariate normal distribution. Consequently, the assumption of multivariate normality may not hold for the dataset. In such cases, caution should be exercised when using statistical methods reliant on multivariate normality assumptions, as these deviations could impact the validity of the analyses based on such assumptions. Further exploration or alternative analytical approaches might be necessary to account for the non-normality observed in the dataset.

A high p-value (>0.05) resulting from Mardia's test indicates insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the dataset conforms to a multivariate normal distribution. This suggests that the dataset demonstrates characteristics akin to a multivariate normal distribution, supporting the assumption of multivariate normality. In such instances, there is no strong indication of substantial deviations, such as asymmetry or heavy-tailed distributions, that would contradict the assumption of multivariate normality. Therefore, statistical methods relying on this assumption can be reasonably applied to the dataset for subsequent analyses, as the evidence suggests compatibility with multivariate normality.


This code segment utilizes three R packages: mvtnorm, MVN, and MASS, loading them into the current R session. Subsequently, it generates a sample dataset named 'data' comprising 100 observations and two variables following a bivariate normal distribution. The set.seed(123) ensures reproducibility by setting a specific seed value for the random number generator, guaranteeing that the generated dataset remains the same across different executions. The mvrnorm() function from the mvtnorm package is used to create the dataset, specifying the number of observations (n = 100), the mean vector (mu = c(2, 3)), and the covariance matrix Sigma = matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.5, 2), 2, 2) that determines the distribution's characteristics, such as means, variances, and covariances between the variables X and Y. The resulting 'data' variable holds the generated dataset reflecting these defined parameters of the bivariate normal distribution.

```{r}
# Load the MVN & mvtnorm packages
library(mvtnorm)
library(MVN) 
library(MASS)

# Generating a sample dataset with 100 observations and two variables
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
data <- mvrnorm(n = 100, mu = c(2, 3), Sigma = matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.5, 2), 2, 2))
head(data)
```

The generated 'data' variable is a dataset comprising 100 observations and two variables, let's call them X and Y. These variables are simulated to follow a bivariate normal distribution specified by the mean vector [μ₁ = 2, μ₂ = 3] and the covariance matrix [[σ₁² = 1, ρ = 0.5], [ρ = 0.5, σ₂² = 2]]. Each row in the 'data' dataset represents a single observation, with the first column corresponding to X values and the second column representing Y values. These values are generated in a way that follows the characteristics of a bivariate normal distribution, meaning the data's distribution will exhibit a tendency around the mean vector [2, 3] and will reflect the covariance matrix's characteristics, including the relationship (correlation) between X and Y. The 'set.seed(123)' function call ensures that the same dataset is generated whenever this code is executed due to the specified seed value, allowing for reproducibility in analyses or simulations based on this dataset.




This code below conducts a test for multivariate normality on the generated 'data' dataset using the 'mvn' function from the 'MVN' package in R. The test specifically employs the Mardia's multivariate normality test, indicated by the argument 'mvnTest = "mardia"'. Additionally, it generates a QQ plot, displaying quantiles of the observed data against those of a normal distribution, enabled by 'multivariatePlot = "qq"'. The 'mardia_test' variable stores the results of this test. The 'print(mardia_test)' line prints out the test results, revealing statistical information such as test statistics, p-values, and diagnostic plots, aiding in assessing whether the dataset's variables adhere to the assumption of multivariate normality.

```{r}
# Perform the test for multivariate normality
mardia_test <- mvn(data, mvnTest = "mardia", multivariatePlot = "qq")

# Print the test results
print(mardia_test)

```

Multivariate Normality: The Mardia test examines skewness and kurtosis for multivariate normality. The obtained statistics and p-values for skewness (p = 0.062) and kurtosis (p = 0.723) indicate that while skewness is somewhat significant, both are not substantially different from a normal distribution at conventional significance levels (p > 0.05), suggesting adherence to multivariate normality. The 'Result' column confirms the conclusion.

Univariate Normality: The Anderson-Darling test, applied to each variable (Column1 and Column2), assesses their individual normality. Both variables exhibit p-values greater than 0.05, indicating that neither variable significantly deviates from univariate normality assumptions.

Descriptives: The descriptive statistics provide an overview of the dataset, showing mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and quartile values for each variable. Skewness and kurtosis measures depict slight deviations from perfect normality but generally fall within acceptable ranges.

Overall, the statistical tests and descriptive statistics suggest that the 'data' dataset generally adheres well to both multivariate and univariate normality assumptions, with minor deviations indicated by the slight significance in skewness for multivariate normality. The visual inspection through QQ plots offers a clearer understanding of the extent of departure from normality.



#### Multivariate Normality Test using Henze-Zirkler
The Henze-Zirkler test stands as a non-parametric method used to evaluate whether a dataset conforms to a multivariate normal distribution or significantly deviates from it. This test relies on comparing the empirical characteristic function of the dataset with that of a multivariate normal distribution, assessing the L2 distance between the two functions. 

A low p-value (<0.05) from this test signifies substantial departure from multivariate normality, indicating rejection of the assumption that the dataset follows a multivariate normal distribution. It serves as a valuable tool to detect deviations such as skewness, heavy tails, or outliers that might invalidate the multivariate normality assumption, making it essential in various fields, particularly for researchers relying on methods contingent upon this assumption for accurate statistical inferences.

A high p-value (>0.05) from the Henze-Zirkler test suggests insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the dataset follows a multivariate normal distribution. This indicates that the dataset exhibits characteristics similar to those of a multivariate normal distribution, implying that the assumption of multivariate normality holds. In such cases, there is no strong indication of significant deviations, such as skewness, heavy tails, or outliers, that would contradict the multivariate normality assumption, thereby supporting the use of methods reliant on this assumption for statistical analyses.


This code below utilizes the 'mvrnorm()' function from the 'MASS' package in R to generate hypothetical data simulating a multivariate normal distribution. The 'set.seed(123)' ensures reproducibility by setting a specific seed value for the random number generator. The 'mvrnorm()' function generates a dataset named 'data' consisting of 100 observations and two variables, following a bivariate normal distribution. This distribution is characterized by a mean vector [μ₁ = 2, μ₂ = 3] and a covariance matrix [[σ₁² = 1, ρ = 0.5], [ρ = 0.5, σ₂² = 2]], where σ₁² and σ₂² represent variances and ρ denotes the correlation between the two variables. Each row in the 'data' dataset represents a single observation, with the first column corresponding to X values and the second column representing Y values conforming to these specified distributional characteristics.

```{r}
library(MASS)
# Generate hypothetical data
set.seed(123)
data <- mvrnorm(n = 100, mu = c(2, 3), Sigma = matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.5, 2),2,2))
head(data)

```

Each row in the 'data' dataset reflects a specific observation generated from this bivariate normal distribution. These simulated values follow the distribution's characteristics, showcasing tendencies around the mean vector and adhering to the specified correlation and variance values between X and Y.




This code below employs the 'MVN' package in R to conduct a test for multivariate normality on the 'data' dataset. The 'mvn()' function is used to perform the test, specifically applying the Henze-Zirkler test (mvnTest = "hz") for assessing multivariate normality. Additionally, it generates a QQ plot ('multivariatePlot = "qq"') visually comparing quantiles of the observed data against those expected under a perfectly normal distribution. The 'mvn_test' variable stores the results of this test. The subsequent 'print(mvn_test)' displays the test results, presenting statistical information such as test statistics and p-values, aiding in evaluating whether the dataset adheres to the assumption of multivariate normality. This test is essential for ensuring the validity of various statistical analyses reliant on this assumption.

```{r}
# Test for multivariate normality
library(MVN)  # Load library for mvn test
mvn_test <- mvn(data, mvnTest = "hz", multivariatePlot = "qq")

# Interpret results
print(mvn_test)

```

Multivariate Normality: The Henze-Zirkler test yields a test statistic of 0.4517 with a corresponding p-value of 0.7048. In this case, the p-value is greater than 0.05, indicating that there isn't strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis of multivariate normality. Thus, the dataset tends to follow a multivariate normal distribution based on this test.

Univariate Normality: The Anderson-Darling tests for each variable (Column1 and Column2) check their individual normality. Both variables exhibit p-values greater than 0.05, suggesting that neither variable significantly deviates from univariate normality.

Descriptives: The descriptive statistics provide an overview of the dataset, including mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and quartile values for each variable. Skewness and kurtosis measures are also displayed, showing slight deviations from perfect normality but generally fall within acceptable ranges.

Overall, both multivariate and univariate normality tests, along with descriptive statistics, indicate that the 'data' dataset conforms well to normality assumptions, with minor deviations that are acceptable for many statistical analyses. The Henze-Zirkler test specifically supports the conclusion of multivariate normality for this dataset.



### (c) Scenarios and impact of deviations from multivariate normality:
#### Deviations from multivariate normality on subsequent statistical analyses:

Outliers: Outliers, or extreme values, have the potential to significantly impact the normality assumption of a dataset. They can distort the distribution's symmetry and affect estimates of central tendency and dispersion. In multivariate datasets, outliers might create non-normal tails or skewness, challenging the assumption of normally distributed data. Consequently, parametric tests relying on normality might become sensitive to these extreme values, potentially leading to biased estimates and affecting the overall validity of statistical inferences. Detecting and appropriately handling outliers is crucial to ensure the robustness and accuracy of subsequent analyses.

Nonlinear Relationships: Multivariate normality assumes linear relationships between variables. When relationships are nonlinear, the distribution's shape might deviate from the expected elliptical pattern. Nonlinearities can cause curvature or non-elliptical contours in the distribution, impacting the assumption of multivariate normality. Consequently, parametric methods assuming linearity, such as linear regression, might provide biased estimates or inaccurate predictions due to the violation of this assumption.

Multimodal Distributions: Multimodal distributions, characterized by multiple peaks or clusters in the data, indicate the presence of distinct subgroups or patterns. Such distributions deviate from the unimodal, symmetric pattern of a normal distribution. Multimodal distributions violate the assumption of unimodal, single-peaked distributions, affecting the validity of parametric tests. Analysis methods assuming a single mode might fail to capture the complexity of the data, leading to erroneous conclusions or incomplete insights.




#### Impacts of deviation from multivariate normality profoundly on subsequent statistical analyses in several ways. 

Firstly, parametric tests, like regression or ANOVA, inherently assume normality in the underlying data. When this assumption is violated due to non-normality, the estimations made by these tests might become biased or inaccurate. In practical terms, this means regression coefficients or ANOVA effects might not accurately represent the relationships between variables or groups, leading to faulty conclusions or misguided recommendations based on these analyses. 

Secondly, confidence intervals and hypothesis tests rely on the assumption of normality for their validity. Deviations from multivariate normality can render these statistical tools unreliable or invalid, affecting the precision of estimations and the correctness of conclusions drawn from these intervals or tests. 

Lastly, in the realm of machine learning, algorithms assuming normality or requiring normally distributed residuals might falter in the presence of non-normal data. Models like linear regression or Gaussian-based algorithms may yield suboptimal performance, as their assumptions about data distribution might not hold, impacting predictive accuracy or model generalization. In all these cases, recognizing and addressing deviations from multivariate normality becomes crucial to ensure the reliability and validity of subsequent analyses and model outputs.
